Welcome to my GitHub profile! Im currently a marketing student at [Loyola University Chicago](https://www.luc.edu/). Here I am studying **marketing** with a minor in **computer science**.
About halfway through my collegiate journey and some marketing experience, I found that coding was a better fit for me. Since then, I have been learning Web Development with [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/)

### 🚀 Expertise

- Programming Languages: JavaScript, HTML, CSS
- Tools: React, Git, Webpack, Babel, Vite, Fima, Canva, Jest
- Other: SEO, Data analysis, QA Testing, Algorithms, Web API integration
- Soft Skills: Excellent communication, collaboration, and public speaking

### 💡 Interests

- Building interesting projects!
- Open-source projects (Specificly The Odin Project) -- I am an active community member in their discord and contribute to their curriculum as much as I Can!

### 📚 Hobbies

Apart from coding, I enjoy:

- Doing Wordle!! (Gotta get it done everyday)
- Listening to all kinds of music
- Hanging out with friends!

### 🌱 Future Goals

My ultimate goal is to become a web-developer. I would love to stay in the tech-industry as that is where my past internships have been. Before then I hope to land internships as a web-developer!
